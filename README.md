# Push Swap

## Overview

Push Swap is a sorting algorithm project at 42 School. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of stack operations in the fewest possible moves. This project aims to develop algorithmic skills and optimize sorting strategies.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Implements various sorting algorithms to efficiently sort the stack.
- **Optimization:** Focuses on optimizing sorting algorithms to minimize the number of moves required.
- **Visualizer:** Provides a visualizer tool to visualize the sorting process step by step.
- **Error Handling:** Includes error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and edge cases.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ychbily/push_swap.git

2. Compile the project:

make
